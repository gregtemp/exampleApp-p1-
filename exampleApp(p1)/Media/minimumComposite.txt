The minimumComposite filter computes the minimum value, by color component, of two input images and creates an output image using the minimum values.  It is similar to burning.
[intro]
Call the minimumComposite filter method from the source image (image you want to affect), and use your affecting image as the "background image".

[image minimumComposite:backgroundImage];

TIP: The formula used to create this filter is described in Thomas Porter and Tom Duff. 1984. Compositing Digital Images. Computer Graphics, 18 (3): 253-259.
