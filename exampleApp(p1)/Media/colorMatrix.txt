The colorMatrix filter multiplies source color values and adds a bias factor to each color component.
[intro]
Call the colorMatrix filter method from the source image (image you want to affect).
 
_color_ is a UIColor whose components will be used in the matrix multiplication.

_bias_ is the *amount* that you want the _color_ to affect the image (ranges from 0.0f to 1.0f).
