The colorBurn filter darkens the background image samples to reflect the source image samples.
[intro]
Call the colorBurn filter method from the source image (image you want to affect), and use your affecting image as the "background image".

[image colorBurn:backgroundImage];

TIP: Source image sample values that specify white do not produce a change.
