The overlayBlend filter either multiplies or screens the source image samples with the background image samples.
[intro]
Call the overlayBlend filter method from the source image (image you want to affect), and use your affecting image as the "background image". The result is to overlay the existing image samples while preserving the highlights and shadows of the background. The background color mixes with the source image to reflect the lightness or darkness of the background.
