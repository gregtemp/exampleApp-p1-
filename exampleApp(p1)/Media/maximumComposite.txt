The maximumComposite filter creates an image by choosing the maximum values (by color component) of two input images.  It is similar to link:colorDodge[dodging].
[intro]
Call the maximumComposite filter method from the source image (image you want to affect), and use your affecting image as the "background image".

TIP: The formula used to create this filter is described in Thomas Porter and Tom Duff. 1984. Compositing Digital Images. Computer Graphics, 18 (3): 253-259.
