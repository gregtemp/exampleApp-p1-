The exposureAdjust filter adjusts the exposure setting for an image similar to the way you control exposure for a camera when you change the F-stop.
[intro]
Call the exposureAdjust filter method from the source image (image you want to affect). 

The level of exposure adjustment defaults to 0.5, within a range from -10.0f to 10.0f
