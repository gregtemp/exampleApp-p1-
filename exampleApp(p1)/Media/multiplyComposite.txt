The multiplyComposite filter multiplies the color component of two input images and creates an output image using the multiplied values.  This filter is typically used to add a spotlight or similar lighting effect to an image.
[intro]
Call the multiplyComposite filter method from the source image (image you want to affect), and use your affecting image as the "background image".
