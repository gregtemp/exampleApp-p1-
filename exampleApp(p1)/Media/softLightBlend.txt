The softLightBlend filter either darkens or lightens colors, depending on the source image sample color.
[intro]
Call the softLightBlend filter method from the source image (image you want to affect), and use your affecting image as the "background image".   

- If the source image sample color is *lighter* than 50% gray, the background is lightened, similar to dodging. 
- If the source image sample color is *darker* than 50% gray, the background is darkened, similar to burning. 
- If the source image sample color is *equal* to 50% gray, the background is not changed. 
- Image samples that are equal to pure black or pure white produce darker or lighter areas, but do not result in pure black or white. 

The overall effect is similar to what you would achieve by shining a diffuse spotlight on the source image.
